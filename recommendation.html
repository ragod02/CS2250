					Jujutsu Kaisen is a great show with great anime and plot.
					As the viewer we dive into the story of Yuji Itadori as we 
					experience the world of curses along side him. The show has 
					a great cast of characters, which all have their time to shine
					as if they were the main characters too. Season 3 is set for 
					this January and I am excited to see what it can offer.
				</li>
				<li>
					Konosuba is one of my favorite reincarnation stories because of 
					the mix of high fantasy and commedy. Originally I went into 
					expecting this to be more of a serious story, but came out pleasently 
					surprised. Besides the commedy the story is great too as we follow 
					Kazuma, where he gets through deadly encounters despite being weak.
					With high quality animation and story, it only makes sense how it 
					has a movie, a spin off show, 4 OVA's, and 4th season coming out.
				</li>
				<li>
					I had no clue what I was getting myself into when watching Erased, 
					but I am happy that I watched it. The plot of going into the past of
					solving your childhood friend's murder kept me engaged. The twist near the
					end was also great and shocked me. I felt like I was solving the mystery 
					along side with the main character, Satoru. A sad but good story for those 
					who want a mystery show.

				<li>
					Magi has to be one of my favorite pieces of fiction.
					I started with the Anime, but after the shows has been 
					canceled I moved to reading the manga. I loved the hand drawn
					art better than the anime and just how they show the scale of the 
					magic as well. The story starts as a magical adventure, but later dives 
					into topics like self worth. Would recommend to those who enjoy
					magic.
				</li>
				<li>
					Berserk's story has been popular for decades, and I am here to continue 
					the praise it deserves. I went into Berserk thinking there was going to 
					be a lot of fighting, but it is much more than just fighting. It is a story 
					of a man who grows up in a hostile environment, which sets him on a path of 
					a mercenary, but then one day changed. He made friends, he met the love of his life, 
					and he met the man who respects the most. He changed and his heart warmed, despite 
					the many battles he faced. All of that changed once the man he respected the most 
					took everything from him and now he is on a quest of revenge. This story is very dark
					and is not recommended to those who can't handle dark themes, but it is truely
					a great story.
				</li>
				<li>
					Choujin X is my recommendations for people who getting into reading manga. This is a relativley 
					new manga and has an interesting story. We follow Tokio who is a young man living 
					in an alternate world where there are beings called Choujin. These are beings 
					who have powers, but still look like human. There are a force of Choujin who protect 
					citizens from the bad Choujin, and our character is the main target for these bad Choujin.
					I think it is a great story, and probably not that hard to get into considering how young it is.

				<li>
					Baldur's Gate 3 is 100% my favorite game right now. I have dedicated 100's of hours into it, 
					and I technically only beat the game twice. The game is addicting because 
					of the amount of freedom you have to creating your characters, making descisions, 
					and the amount locations you can visit. The replayabilty is through the roof and 
					you can make multiple playthroughs and find something new most likely. The mechanics can
					be a bit daunting to those who are not used to the top down view, but I recommend the struggle 
					as it will be worth it as you get a hang of it.
				</li>
				<li>
					Elden Ring used to be my favorite game, but definetly my top 3 of all time. This game plays differently
					from Baldur's Gate as you are controlling a character in a 3rd person view. The gameplay
					is much more intimate since you are always doing something like attacking or dodging. Don't worry,
					combat is not restricted as all since you can choose multiple ways to play. You can choose to wield giant
					weapons to crash on oppoents, swiftly attacking with small weapons multiple times, or even casting spells 
					that have powerful affects. The replayability is high as you can make new characters with different
					playstyles. I recommend this game to those who don't mind playing a game where they are going to lose a lot.

				</li>
				<li>
					Marvel Rivals is a very different game from the other 2 games, but I wanted recommend
					to those with different tastes. This is a game where you play as a team of Marvel
					Superheros, trying to gain control over an objective. The reason I recommend this 
					game is because these characters are recognizable for most people, 
					especially since marvel movies were popular before. This game can be played with 5 other 
					people too, so if you had other friends then there is a lot of space for them to join.
					The game is only online multiplayer, so it is constantly being updating and gaining new 
					content. For the most part the replayability is good since there are an assortment of 
					characters to choose from and you can get new teams to play against, but you can get burnt 
					if you are constantly playing.
