				<p>
					Hello my name is Raymond. I was born and raised in 
					Southern California, and I have been in college for 5 years and a half; 
					this is my last semester before I graduate. I started my college 
					journey in Chaffey College, and I transfered here to  Cal Poly Pomona 
					2 years ago. I took this class since I wanted to increase my skills 
					in making and managing websites since 
					I feel like my work in Software Engineering wasn't the best I can 
					do. Hopefully I can put in the time and show some great work for this 
					class. 
				</p>

				<!-- Requirement-1.K -->
				<ul>
					<li>

						<!-- Requirement-1.H -->
						I love reading things like <span>manga</span> or <span>light novels</span>, especially 
						if they are in fantasy settings.

					</li>
					<li>
						I like <span>anime</span> too! A lot of times I have read the manga or light novel first, 
						but I always appreciate watching it again since its a different way to 
						experience the stories I love.
					</li>
					<li>
						I like to play <span>video games</span>. I like a variety of games like
						FPS's, but I think I am more of an RPG person.
					</li>
					<li> 
						I love playing <span>Dungeons and Dragons</span> with my friends. It is 
						just a good time and I just love fantasy settings.
					</li>
				</ul>
